# Assets Directory

This directory contains website assets (images, icons, etc.).

## Note on Missing Assets

The original GitHub repository did not include the `/assets/` directory with images. 
SVG placeholders have been created for:
- Logo files
- Favicon files
- Pattern backgrounds

## To Add Real Assets

1. Upload actual logo and image files to this directory
2. Maintain the existing file structure:
   - `/assets/images/` - logos, photos, graphics
   - `/assets/favicons/` - favicon files

The HTML references PNG files, but SVG files work as substitutes for now.
