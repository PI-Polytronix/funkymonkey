 <h2>How We Think About Acquisitions</h2>
 <p>Our acquisition strategy is focused on long-term ownership of specialized manufacturing businesses where continuity, quality, and operational discipline matter. We acquire companies to keep them operating, investing in their people, systems, and infrastructure so they can continue supporting customers reliably for years to come.<p>
 <p>When we evaluate a potential acquisition, we focus on whether the business can continue supporting customers reliably through an ownership transition. Our criteria are shaped by what matters most in long-lifecycle manufacturing environments: continuity, quality, and disciplined operations. We look for businesses that are already doing the right things and would benefit from long-term ownership rather than short-term change. The sections below outline the characteristics we typically see in businesses that are a good fit.</p>
 <p class="mt-4">We focus on stability and long-term ownership; therefore, we go deep into due diligence.</p>
