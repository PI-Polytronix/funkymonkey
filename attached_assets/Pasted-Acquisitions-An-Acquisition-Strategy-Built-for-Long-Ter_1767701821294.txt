Acquisitions
 
An Acquisition Strategy Built for Long-Term Manufacturing Programs
 
In aerospace and industrial markets, products and programs last a long time.
Manufacturing partners need to do the same.
 
Our acquisition strategy is focused on long-term ownership of specialized manufacturing businesses where continuity, quality, and operational discipline matter. We acquire companies to keep them operating, investing in their people, systems, and infrastructure so they can continue supporting customers reliably for years to come.
 
We are not focused on short-term exits or rapid consolidation. Our goal is to be a stable, long-term owner.

How We Think About Acquisitions
 
When we evaluate a potential acquisition, we focus on whether the business can continue supporting customers reliably through an ownership transition. Our criteria are shaped by what matters most in long-lifecycle manufacturing environments: continuity, quality, and disciplined operations. We look for businesses that are already doing the right things and would benefit from long-term ownership rather than short-term change. The sections below outline the characteristics we typically see in businesses that are a good fit.
